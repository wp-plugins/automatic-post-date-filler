Automatically sets custom date and time when editing posts.

== Description ==
This plugin **overrides default date and time** of edited posts with dynamically calculated custom values. This is useful especially when **scheduling posts**; the plugin can, for example, automatically generate new post dates by incrementing the current most future post date by a specified number of days.

Calculated custom date and time will automatically replace default values after clicking the "Edit" link next to "Publish immediately" in the post editor's Publish module.

= Features =
* Date/time values usable as a reference: current date/time, oldest or most future post date/time; specific time of day
* Date/time of reference can be increased or decreased by a specific number of days/minutes
* Configurable post types and statuses of analyzed and affected posts
